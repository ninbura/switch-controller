# Switch Controller

A [StreamController](https://github.com/StreamController/StreamController) plugin for controlling signal switchers. The intended scope is input switching, not full device configuration. For anything beyond that, I would suggest using the manufacturer's first-party software.

## Supported Devices

### TESmart
All IP-connected TESmart switches should work. Tested on:
- TESmart 8-Port 4K60 HDMI Switch (HSW801-E23)

### HDFury
All IP-connected HDFury switches should work. Tested on:
- HDFury VRROOM

## Usage

Add a **TESmart: Switch Input** or **HDFury: Switch Input** action to a button. Configure the IP address and which input to switch to. The button highlights when that input is active.

## Development Setup

Clone into your StreamController plugins directory:

```bash
cd ~/.var/app/com.core447.StreamController/data/plugins
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ninbura/switch-controller
```

### Serial Port Setup

To use the **TESmart: Switch Input (Serial)** action, run the setup script once after cloning:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This adds your user to the `dialout` group and grants StreamController Flatpak access to host devices. After it completes, reboot the Pi.

### Updating Vendored Dependencies

The `serial/` package (pyserial) is vendored directly in the repo. To update it:

```bash
pip3 install --target . --no-deps --upgrade pyserial
```
